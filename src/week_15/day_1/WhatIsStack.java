/*
In Java, a stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Think of a stack as a collection of items stacked on top of each other, similar to a stack of
plates. The last plate placed on the stack is the first one to be removed.

Programming-wise, you can implement a stack in java using the Stack class or by using the
Deque interface, specifically the ArrayDeque or LinkedList classes.
