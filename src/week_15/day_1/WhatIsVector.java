    /*
    In Java, a vector is a dynamic, resizable data structure that can store a collection of
    elements. It is similar to an array but can grow or shrink in size as needed.
    Think of a vector as a flexible container, like a bag, where you can add or remove
    items easily.

    Programming-wise, a vector is part of the java Collections Framework and is represented
    by the Vector class.
