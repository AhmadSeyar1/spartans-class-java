    /*
    Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
    The word "Polymorphism" comes from the Greek words "Poly" (Means many) and "morph" (means forms).
    Int the context of OOP, polymorphism allows Objects to be treated as if they are object of another type.

    In Java, polymorphism primarily manifests in two forms:
    1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):
    This occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
