        LinkedList is a part of Java collection framework (java.util package) and
        represents a doubly-linked list. contains two pieces of information: the data and a
        reference to the next (and in the case of a doubly-linked list, the previous) node in the sequence.

        Int linkedList access the information is not faster. if you work in a scenario that
        you're continuously going to access the values then linkedList is not the perfect collection

        In the scenario of add or remove something LinkedList is fast and good.

        If we add or remove and element from LinkedList the address of the element will not
        be changed only the index number will be changed.
