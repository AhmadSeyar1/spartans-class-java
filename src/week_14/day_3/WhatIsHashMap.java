public class WhatIsHashMap {
    /*
    HashMap is one of the most widely used implementations of the Map interface in Java.
    It stores data in key-value pairs, and it allows you to retrieve a value based on its
    associated key. HashMap works by using a hashing technique, where the keys are processed
    by a hash function to produce an index in an array, where the corresponding value will
    be stored.

    Characteristics of HashMap
    -Unordered: the elements (key-value pairs) in a HashMap are not ordered
    -Key Uniqueness: Each key in the HashMap must be unique. If you try to insert
    a key-value pair with a key that's already in the map, the old value for that
    key will be replaced.
    -Allwos Null: HashMap allows one null key and ultiple mull values.
