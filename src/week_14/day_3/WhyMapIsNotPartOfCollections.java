    The term "Java Collections Framework" (JCF) often refers to the framework in the
    java.util package, which includes core collection interfaces like List, Set and Queue.
    However, Map is a bit of an outlier. While it is part of the same framework and is
    closely related, it doesn't technically extend the collection interface, whereas List,
    Set, and Queue do.
